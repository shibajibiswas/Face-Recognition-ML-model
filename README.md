# Face-Recognition-ML-model
Data preprocessing, ML models for face identification and emotion recognition

Identification of face and fetching the face features data are done by using DNNs res10_300x300_ssd_iter_140000.caffemodel and openface.nn4.small2.v1.t7. Model is build on SVM, Random Forest, and Logistic regression classifiers and employing a voting classifier on it.
